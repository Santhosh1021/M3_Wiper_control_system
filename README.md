# M3_Wiper_control_system
Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed
and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear
window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper
arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots.Existing system manually used control stalk to activate wiper and the process of pulling up wiper is difficult to be
handled. The driver needs to switch on and off the control stalk and it will reduce the driverâ€™s concentration during the
driving. Thus, this system is proposed to solve all these problems
